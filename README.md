# DRN  (Dungeon Runner Nyq'ist)

<h2>Overview</h2>
This is going to be a long running project of me trying to build my idea for a turn-based JRPG in Unity. I am going to be working on it intermittently over a long period
of time rather than limiting it to a couple months like past projects. This is my first attempt at this project in Unity. I worked on simple version back in GameMaker
when I was still learning the basics of game development. This version is going to be focused on the combat system, adding various types of player actions as well as 
various enemy types. Equipment, damage types, and other effects will be added as well.

<br /><br />

<h3>Currently implemented:</h3>
- Combat loop with simple UI<br />
- Basic player actions<br />
- 3 enemy types

<br /><br />

<h3>Planned for addition:</h3>
- Equipment<br />
- More enemy types<br />
- More player action types<br />
- Spells (referred to as Techs in game)<br />
- Equipment effects<br />
- Damage Types<br />


<h2>New Repository Update</h2>
<p>This project came from a previous repository that contained 3rd party assets. The following packages are also needed in order to run the project properly. If opened without the multi-scene package, note that the following scenes need to be loaded in the following order: Initialization, Combat Scene, and Player Combat UI. You will need to do this in order to properly play the game in Unity. 3rd party art, music, and effects will be excluded as they are added if redistribution of those assets are not allowed.</p>
